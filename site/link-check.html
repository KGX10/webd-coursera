			Gareth Bale is easily one of the biggest superstars in world football and the player could be on his way to the MLS during the next transfer window.

The player made a move to Real Madrid in the summer of 2013 from Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur but he’s never been able to hit it off in Spain, playing mostly second fiddle to Cristiano Ronaldo.

And to make matters worse, over the past couple of seasons, he’s had a real scuffle with Zidane Zidane and the problems had reached a point where Gareth Bale even admitted that he was “more excited” while playing for his country than Real Madrid.

Now while talking about the MLS, the 30-year-old has praised the American league hinting at a possible move out of the Bernabeu.

“I would definitely be interested in it,” Bale told the ICC’s ‘The Hat Trick’ podcast, as reported by BBC.

“I really like the league, it’s grown so much over the years.

“When we come over and play them in pre-season, the games are difficult, the standard is getting a lot better. The clubs are improving, the facilities are improving, the stadiums are improving.

“I think it’s a league that’s on the up and still rising. I think a lot more players want to come over to America now and play."

Can the MLS afford a player like Gareth Bale?
In December of last year, Bale’s agent had admitted he was not too happy at Real Madrid but will remain at the club since he has a deal there.

Jonathan Barnett said: “He’s not ecstatic.

“He has got a contract and as long as he is a Real Madrid player he will play at 100% – and do very well. He wants to win the championship and the European championship and everything else. It will not affect his performance.”

And now him praising the MLS has all the signs of a possible summer transfer out of the La Liga.

Gareth Bale has two years left on his current deal at Real Madrid meaning Perez could very well try and cash in on him at the end of this season. But we think, he’ll not be heading to the MLS simply cause the American teams cannot afford to pay his current wages.

Right now, the Welsh international ears a staggering £600,000 per week at the Bernabeu and this is the type of figure which the North American clubs just cannot afford after such a massive financial crisis due to the worldwide lockdowns.

There have been talks of Gareth Bale moving to China last summer and as things standFree Web Content, the winger heading East looks a much better possibility than joining an MLS side.

			Maldini, who broke through as a teenager, endured 25 seasons at the absolute top of the world, hanging the bushes just a month before his 41st birthday. Always a calm and dignified gentleman who preferred elegance and reason to a raw physical struggle. Il Capitano, Captain. They probably won't be made anymore.

Maybe they are friendly?

In 1996, in the middle of a warm summer day, the moon was overshadowed by the sun. The dreaded force surfaced. Satan's hoof kicked the Colosseum, Rome's largest amphitheatre, into a burning football field where earthly stars had to face demons from hell. It was a battle of good with evil, all or nothing.

"Maybe they're friendly?" asks Paolo Maldini at the beginning of this legendary Nike ad . And Eric Cantona gets a condemning look. From the first moments, it really seems that the stars are in big trouble: Luis Figo is barely escaping crushing, Rui Costa is knocked out in the air fight with his elbow knocked out, Ian Wright is treated to a stomach with a kick. If an Englishman dares to demand the right from a judge, he will face it face to face.

A moment later, four hell demons are already attacking Jorge Campos' goal. The Mexican is not a cardboard boy, of course, and rushes to the rescue to save the world, but before that he arrives in Maldini with a measured slip. After tackling, he takes two more opponents out of the game with accurate diagonal passing, thus launching an attack that will help save the world. Goodness wins again.

Maldini’s character emerges most clearly from this 90-second valve - a maybe gentleman who, at first glance, even in masks, has a positive attitude towards the inhabitants of hell, but when it comes to the game, it is robotically analytical and surgically accurate. If Maldini had played on the demons side ...

For a man who has spent a quarter of a century at the top of the world, Maldini’s career sends surprisingly few entities. If you were born on top, why should you leave? Of course, there were worse years in Milan, but if your first and last triumph of the Champions League is separated by 18 years, the decision can be approved. Just a decision, because he went to sue.

The closest was to Maldini's signature, Real Madrid - the legendary defender has admitted that if someone called Bernabeult on time, ... But contact was sought only in the early 2000s when Maldini was well over 30 years old. Then he no longer wanted to. He was called from London earlier. Arsenal, Chelsea, the 90s. Former teammate Gianluca Vialli coached Chelsea from 1998-2000, and although Maldini has said he has made up his mind, he finally decided to stay true to his heart. "It was the first and last time I ever thought about leaving," he once told Sky Sports.

Everyone understood Maldini’s decision. Kindly. So is Sir Alex Ferguson. "I wanted Paolo. We met his father, Cesare, who was a dignified man. He only answered me with a shake of his head, I couldn't do anything else. Or not, or not, he said something," the Scot recalled at a conference a few years ago. What did Cesare Maldini say then?

"My grandfather was Milan, my father was Milan, I'm MilanComputer Technology Articles, my son is Milan. Forget it."
